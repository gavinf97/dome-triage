    mask.any(): continue` branch below and be **silently discarded** -- a direct violation of

    Looks each missing record_id up in the bulk pool (recomputing the same
    `dedupe.keys.record_id_from_ids` hash per row -- there's no `record_id` column on the raw bulk
    file itself) and, for every one found, builds a real `CanonicalRecord` from that row via the

    `canonical_key`/`record_id`, `label="unlabeled"`/`label_confidence=None` -- matching
    `dedupe.conflicts.merge_label`'s convention for a fresh unlabeled cluster, not the raw
    `"unscored"` string the bulk file happens to carry), then appends it to `dataset` via
    `dedupe.consolidate.to_dataframe` (the same JSON-encoding used for every other canonical row,
    not a hand-rolled second encoder). The caller's existing per-event loop then runs unchanged --
    the newly-inserted row now has a real `label`/`label_confidence` for that loop's
    conflict-detection logic to compare the event's decision against, exactly like any
    already-existing row.

    Returns `(dataset_with_inserts, still_missing)` -- `still_missing` is whatever's left of
    `missing_record_ids` that wasn't found in the bulk pool either (e.g. it came from a queue
    source outside both files, or the bulk pool file has since been regenerated with different

    A decision that lands cleanly (no conflict) also upgrades that row's `label_confidence` to
    `human_curated` -- a decision recorded through the Curate app is a real human judgment, on par
    with any other human_curated source, not a lesser tier. Before this, a record that started as

    confidence untouched (it's already trusted-tier by definition -- that's what made it a
    conflict in the first place; there's nothing to upgrade).
